			"title": "Optimized the Pine Tree Class",
			"details": [
				"Implemented pre-rendering for all pine tree layers and stored the rendered images in an array. During drawing, pre-rendered images are used instead of recalculating points and redrawing each frame. This significantly reduces CPU usage.",
				"Added a mechanism to check if a pine tree with the same size has already been generated. If a matching size is found, the current tree references the pre-rendered images of the existing tree, reducing memory usage."
